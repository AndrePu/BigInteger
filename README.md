# BigInteger
In this project implemented analog of System.Numerics.BigInteger C# struct in order to consolidate knowledges from topics:
- operators overload;
- Conversion operators overload;

Implemented BigInteger class has following abilities:
- Class Constructor that supports string, int, long type object as input parameter or no parameters at all
- Boolean operations: <,>,>=,<=,==,!=
- Arithmetic Operations: +, *,-
- Implicit casting integers to BigInt Data Type
- Explicit casting strings to BigInt Data Type and on the contrary
- Abs math function for BigInteger!!!
- true/false operators overloading - Now it's shown true in if-statement when BigInt doesn't equal to zero!
- Parse function to parse strings to BigInt data
- Sorting the array of BigIntegers (QuickSort)
- To add Pow static function for BigIntegers
- Finding factorial of quite big number


For the following year I promise that this class will be having next features:
- Dividing `/`
- Sqrt(BigInt) static function;
- NthRoot(BigInt, int) static function;
- Mean(..) static function
- Ukraine Economic will increase on five percents!!
