# BigInteger
To Open the project you need to open the solution by the path:
### BigInteger/BigInteger.sln

In cryptography namespace you can find implementation of the BigInt class and in program.cs you can test all the methods and possibilities in this class.

Also it's popular to work with big numbers during programming competitions. It can take long time to implement definite function and operations for this numbers. So, you can use this BigInt class to complete your programming task without wasting your time.

Now, this class has following features:
- Class Constructor that supports string, int, long type object as input parameter or no parameters at all
- Boolean operations: <,>,>=,<=,==,!=
- Arithmetic Operations: +, *,-
- Implicit casting integers to BigInt Data Type
- Explicit casting strings to BigInt Data Type and on the contrary
- Abs math function for BigInteger!!!
- true/false operators overloading - Now it's shown true in if-statement when BigInt doesn't equal to zero!

For the following year I promise that this class will be having next features:
- Finding factorial of quite big number
- Arithmetic operations /
- Sorting the array of BigIntegers
- Parse function to parse strings to BigInt data
- Ukraine Economic will increase on five percents!!


## P.S Multiplying and adding of negative numbers isn't supported yet. In another words work with positive numbers only!
